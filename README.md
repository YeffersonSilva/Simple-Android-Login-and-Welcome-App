# Simple Android Login and Welcome App

This repository contains an example of a basic Android application that demonstrates how to create a login screen and a subsequent welcome screen. The application verifies the user-entered login credentials and displays a personalized welcome message or an error message, as appropriate.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. **Login Screen:**

    When you open the app, you'll be directed to the login screen. On this screen, you need to enter your username and password. The correct username and password for demonstration purposes are:

    - Username: *example_user*
    - Password: *password123*

2. **Welcome Screen:**

    If the login credentials are correct, you'll be redirected to the welcome screen. On this screen, your username will be displayed in a TextView, giving you a personalized welcome.

3. **Error Handling:**

    If the login credentials are incorrect, an error message will be displayed via a Toast, informing you that the login failed.

## Notes

- This app is just a didactic example and doesn't address security comprehensively. In a real app, you should implement more robust security measures to handle user credentials.

- The UI layout and design haven't been emphasized in this example. In a real scenario, you can enhance the app's appearance using XML layouts and appropriate styles.
